## 🎯 What is WatchMark?

WatchMark is a client-side personal media tracking app for people who watch local video files (anime, TV shows, movies, university lectures) in **VLC Media Player** and want automatic progress tracking without the battery and memory overhead of running a heavy 24/7 media server like Plex or Jellyfin.

> *"I kept losing my place across anime backlogs and lecture folders without wanting a heavy background media server eating battery and RAM, so I built a zero-daemon local tracker."*

### Why It's Different
* **Zero 24/7 Background Servers:** Runs only when you open it. Consumes **15.1 MB idle RAM** and **0.0% background CPU** (and strictly under 50 MB during heavy 1,000+ title library browsing thanks to DOM virtualization).
* **Automatic VLC Telemetry:** Connects directly to VLC via dynamic loopback HTTP (probing ports `8080..8090`). No browser extensions, no manual logging.
* **Exact Playhead Resumption:** Remembers your exact second (`--start-time` resumption) and automatically marks episodes as completed when watched past 90% or within 120 seconds of the credits.
* **Recursive Filesystem Scanner & Triage:** Recursively scans local folders using multi-pattern regex (`S01E01`, `1x01`, `[SubsPlease]`), handles Windows long paths (`\\?\`), and resolves `.lnk` shortcuts into an interactive triage inbox.
* **TMDb Metadata & Local Caching:** Automatically pulls official episode names, synopses, and posters from TMDb, caching them locally on disk for full offline viewing.
* **Custom Video Streaming Protocol (`watchmark://`):** Native asynchronous URI protocol supporting HTTP Range headers (`bytes=start-end`) with 1MB chunked buffers for smooth in-app video playback without memory spikes.
* **Data Durability:** Fully local SQLite database in Write-Ahead Logging (`WAL`) mode with transactional cold-swap restores and automated 3-backup rolling SHA-256 snapshots.

## 🛠️ How WatchMark Was Built: AI-Assisted Engineering & Testing

WatchMark is a **20,740-line desktop codebase** (13,171 lines of Rust across 34 files, 7,569 lines of TypeScript/React across 35 files) built across **522 git commits**. Rather than treating AI as an autocomplete toy or generating monolithic unverified code, development was structured around a human-directed engineering workflow:

1. **Modular Architecture First:** Decomposed the application into decoupled architectural domains (OS shell, async VLC telemetry, SQLite persistence, filesystem ingestion, TMDb synchronization, and virtualized UI) with clear boundaries before writing code.
2. **Context Window Discipline:** Guided coding agents issue-by-issue against concrete milestones, keeping context clean and avoiding code bloat across weeks of development.
3. **Compiler Verification Gates:** Enforced Rust's affine type system (`cargo check`) and TypeScript strict mode (`tsc --noEmit`) to immediately catch lifetime errors, type mismatches, and IPC schema drift before manual code review.
4. **Hands-On QA on Real Hardware:** Tested live builds on physical machines to catch hardware-specific bugs that unit tests cannot catch:
   * **Diagnosed a 70.3% GPU compositor leak** in WebView2 caused by infinite CSS scale transforms under blurred backdrop filters, optimizing it down to **0.0% idle GPU**.
   * **Caught VLC completion edge-cases** where the playhead reset to 0.0 on natural completion, implementing a >90% completion latch.

---

## 🔬 Practical Case Studies

The effectiveness of this development and QA workflow is demonstrated by real engineering challenges resolved during development:

### Case Study 1: The 70.3% GPU Compositor Bottleneck in WebView2
* **The Problem:** In Cinema Mode, the idle desktop app consumed **70.3% GPU utilization** in Windows Task Manager, dropping to 0% when animations were turned off.
* **Diagnosis:** Inspecting the DOM compositor tree revealed an infinite 30-second CSS scale transform (`[1, 1.15, 1]`) in `SafeImage.tsx` running on the 4K backdrop image.
* **Low-Level Root Cause:** Because this high-resolution image was continuously scaling behind elements styled with CSS `backdrop-filter: blur(...)` and gradient overlays, Chromium's GPU compositor was forced to re-rasterize Gaussian blur convolution passes on every single monitor refresh frame (144Hz).
* **Engineering Solution:** Replaced the infinite scale loop with a hardware-accelerated static fade-in. Once mounted, the scale locks at `1.0`. Static high-contrast styling replaced infinite `animate-pulse` tags.
* **Outcome:** **Idle GPU utilization dropped from 70.3% to 0.0% – 1.0%.**

### Case Study 2: Zero-CPU Subprocess Telemetry Loop
* **The Problem:** Monitoring an external video player typically involves busy-waiting or thread sleep loops that waste CPU cycles and battery.
* **Technical Implementation:** Architected an asynchronous child process supervisor in `src-tauri/src/vlc.rs` using `tokio::process::Command` and `tokio::select!`. Implemented dynamic loopback port probing (`8080..8090`) to prevent socket collisions, generated cryptographic one-time HTTP passwords, and polled VLC's status over non-blocking HTTP streams.
* **Outcome:** **0.0% background CPU consumption** and **15.1 MB idle RAM** during active media playback, saving exact-second positions and detecting ≥90% completions.

### Case Study 3: 8-Dimensional Hero Recommendation Scoring Engine
* **The Problem:** Initial versions displayed a single static show in the hero banner, missing opportunities to recommend in-progress series, newly aired episodes, or season finales.
* **Technical Implementation:** Specified an 8-dimensional candidate scoring algorithm implemented in Rust:
  $$\text{Score} = \text{Resume}(+200\text{k}) + \text{FreshAir}(+150\text{k}) + \text{Finale}(+100\text{k}) + \text{Recency} + \text{BingeVelocity} + \text{LocalFile}$$
* **Outcome:** A fluid hero spotlight carousel with 8-second auto-rotation, smooth crossfades, and automatic fallback backfill across the user's library.

## ✨ Application Features

### 🖥️ Fast, Clean Desktop Interface
* **Deep Dark Aesthetic:** Designed around an ultra-dark palette (`#0D0F14`), translucent glassmorphism (`bg-[#1F222A]/60` with `backdrop-blur-md`), and signature VLC Orange accents (`#FF6B00`).
* **Edge-to-Edge Hero Banner:** 450px backdrop banner featuring multi-stop diagonal gradient fades, bold typography, and a 1-click **Resume Watching** action.
* **"Continue Watching" Carousel:** Snap-scrolling row of wide episode cards with bottom-edge progress bars indicating your exact resume point.
* **DOM Virtualization (`VirtualPoster`):** High-performance `IntersectionObserver` windowing engine unmounting off-screen DOM nodes, allowing 1,000+ shows to render at smooth 60 FPS under 50MB RAM (15.1 MB idle).
* **Hardware-Accelerated Fluidity:** View switching and accordion transitions powered by `framer-motion` with built-in `prefers-reduced-motion` battery-saving support.

### 📡 Smart VLC Playhead Telemetry (Zero Background CPU)
* **100% Asynchronous Tracking:** Powered by `tokio::process::Command` and `tokio::select!` event loops consuming zero background CPU while watching.
* **Dynamic Loopback Port Probing:** Automatically detects free local ports between `8080` and `8090` to avoid conflicts, generating a cryptographic one-time session password.
* **Exact-Second Playhead Resumption:** Remembers your exact position in seconds (`last_position`). Launching an episode resumes playback seamlessly via VLC's `--start-time` flag.
* **Intelligent Completion Thresholds:** Automatically marks episodes as completed and increments rewatch counts when you watch **≥ 90%** of the runtime or exit within **120 seconds** of the end credits.
* **Auto-Session Chaining & Isolation:**
  * Episodes watched consecutively within **6 hours** (< 21,600s) are linked into a single cohesive Binge Session UUID.
  * Switching to a different television series immediately terminates the chain and mints a fresh session ID.

### 📖 History Diary & Binge Timeline
* **Interactive BingeBlock Accordions:** Groups multi-episode binges into master-detail accordions with show titles, episode counts, total duration, and smooth auto-height physics.
* **Midnight Crossover Detection:** Calculates UNIX epoch timestamps; if a binge spans past midnight, a distinct `<Moon />` indicator is displayed alongside duration metadata.
* **Detailed Episode Breakdown:** Inspect individual watch timestamps, durations, and pause frequency counters.

### 📁 High-Performance Media Scanner & Triage Inbox
* **Blazing-Fast Directory Traversal:** Recursively scans thousands of nested folders in milliseconds using Rust's `walkdir` and multi-pattern regex (`S01E01`, `1x01`, `Ep 01`, etc.).
* **Windows Long Path & Shortcut Support:** Seamlessly handles deep paths via Windows `\\?\` prefixing and resolves `.lnk` shortcuts using `parselnk`.
* **Chunked IPC Streaming:** Batches file scans in groups of 50 (`scan-match-batch`) to eliminate memory spikes and prevent UI lockups during massive library scans.
* **Persistent Triage Inbox:** Unmatched files are parsed and grouped by extracted title into a dedicated triage inbox for 1-click matching or manual linking.

### 🛡️ Local-First SQLite Engine & Data Integrity
* **ACID Relational Storage:** Managed with `rusqlite` in Write-Ahead Logging mode (`PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;`, `PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;`, `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;`).
* **Evolutionary Migration System:** Safe `ALTER TABLE` transactional migrations update database structures without data loss.
* **Atomic Backup & Restore:** In-app one-click database backups with SHA-256 checksum verification, automated 3-backup rolling retention, and safe restore routines.
* **Database Maintenance:** Built-in SQLite `VACUUM` and `PRAGMA optimize` maintenance tools to keep database queries instantaneous.
* **OS Keyring Integration:** Stores TMDB API keys securely in the Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or Linux Secret Service.
