## 🔒 Security Architecture & Threat Model

WatchMark operates under an **offline-first, client-only architecture**:

1. **Local-Only Database**:
   All user watch history, ratings, and media links are stored locally on your machine in SQLite (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\WatchMark\watchmark.db`). No user data, telemetry, or watch habits are ever transmitted to external servers.

2. **OS Credential Manager (Keyring)**:
   TMDB API credentials are encrypted and stored directly within your operating system's native credential store:
   * **Windows**: Windows Credential Manager
   * **macOS**: Apple Keychain
   * **Linux**: FreeDesktop Secret Service API

3. **Loopback-Only Telemetry (VLC Interface)**:
   WatchMark communicates with VLC Media Player exclusively over loopback TCP interfaces (`127.0.0.1`). Each session dynamically binds a free local port and generates a cryptographic one-time password to prevent unauthorized local processes from probing the interface.

4. **Path Traversal Protection**:
   File scanning and custom streaming handlers route through `filesystem_guard.rs`, strictly validating and canonicalizing paths to prevent directory traversal vulnerabilities.
